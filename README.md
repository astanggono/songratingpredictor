# songratingpredictor
The R script is an essential component of a project focused on predicting the popularity ratings of around 20,000 popular songs based on their auditory attributes. Its primary goal is to construct a robust predictive model capable of accurately forecasting song popularity ratings using an extensive set of song-specific characteristics. Leveraging libraries like tidyr, mice, and dplyr, the script streamlines data analysis and modeling processes, with a strong emphasis on data cleaning and preprocessing. For modeling, the script employs a random forest regression model (forest_ranger), chosen for its ability to handle intricate predictor-target relationships. It encompasses various predictors, from 'pop' to 'acousticness' and 'rock,' all influencing song ratings. The model's performance evaluation relies on calculating Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both training and testing datasets, serving as a measure of prediction quality.
